### TODO:
- Test metac with changes to rbac 
- Make all examples to work & then make it better
- Add integration tests w.r.t GenericController:
    - check if finalizer works
    - check if attachments not created by gctl are not updated
    - check if attachments not created by gctl are not deleted
    - check if ReadOnly works
    - check if UpdateAny works
    - check if DeleteAny works
    - check if same watch can update an attachment via multiple gctl specs
    - check for 2-way merge as well as 3-way merge
        - default to 2-way merge if only finalize hook is present
        - default to 3-way merge if both sync & finalize hooks are present
    - send specific parts of attachments:
        - send - []string{Name, MetaData, Labels, Annotations, Spec, Status} 
        - default sends everything
    - special annotation & label expressions:
        - operator - WatchIsOwner, WatchIsCreator, WatchIsUpdater
        - operator - WatchInKey, WatchInValue, ValueContainsWatch, KeyContainsWatch

### Blogs:
- Integration Tests
    - go based integration tests vs. bash based vs GCtl based
    - Blog talks only about GCtl tests & give links to how Go & Bash are done

### Learn:
- read & review & compare them against GenericController
    - https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/metacontroller/issues/98
    - https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/metacontroller/pull/143
    - https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/metacontroller/pull/168

### Few targeted usecases:
  - K8s ConformanceTest Controllers
  - K8s Controllers
  - K8s Debug Controllers
  - K8s Monitoring Controllers
  - Install
  - UnInstall
  - Upgrade

### Future actions:
- All controller enhancements
  - https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/metacontroller/issues/154
  - make Metac run based on either of following: 
      - CustomResource, or # current mode
      - Config # default mode
  - make cctl, dctl & gctl work from config files vs. current way that depends on CRDs
- Explore the one binary sidecars
    - jsonnetd service + hooks as a docker image
- Use latest stable Kubernetes version & etcd for integration testing
- restructure examples to enable community
- code to use klog
- test/unittest
- find bugs & fix
- Make metacontroller watch resources from specific namespace if required
- Should Metac support UDS?

    if the new client-go dynamic informer does everything metacontroller needs 
    (e.g. start/stop dynamically without process restart), it would be great to
    rebase metacontroller on client-go's dynamic package
