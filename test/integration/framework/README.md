# Integration Testing Framework

This package has been taken from [https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/tree/master/pkg/internal/testing/integration](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/tree/master/pkg/internal/testing/integration).

A framework for integration testing components of kubernetes. This framework is intended to work properly both in CI, and on a local dev machine. It therefore explicitly supports both Linux and Darwin.
